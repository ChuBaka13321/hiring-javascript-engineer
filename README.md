GumGum - JavaScript Engineering Skill Test
==========================================

Introduction
------------

Congratulations, if you're reading this its very likely that you're participating in the exciting
process of joining *GumGum*. So we salute you! If not, its ok.

In this Skill Tests we will try to assest your knowledge and experience when it comes to develop
using JavaScript language for the browser (and maybe out of it too!). We will also cover some other
basic but very important concepts of the coding for the Web Browser.

**What's important for us**

- You are honest to yourself and to us. Its OK to say: _I don't know_, but you must be willing to give your best shot to solve problems and to ask for help.
- GumGum is a very dynamic company, we move fast but we *MUST* move correctly too, everytime. We prefer quality over speed.
- You are a team player, please be considerate while coding. We like clever code, out-of-the-box thinking, but you need to share the magic behind your tricks.
- Pay attention to the details.
- Be communicative.
- Be communicative. Really.

**So, what is covered by this test?**

- JavaScript. Core, raw, pure javascript. We love jQuery too, but this position is not about it.
- JavaScript patterns, OOJS or JSOO, closures, callbacks, scopes, prototypes and all that jazz.
- The Browser(s): DOM, BOM, Developer tools, Debugging, etc.
- Cross-Browser Compatibility: Hacks, Polyfills, performance comparisons, etc.
- Client-side communication.
- HTML(5) and CSS(3). Responsive design.
- Some TDD, some Git, some 3rd party software, etc.

Instructions
------------

- Read these instructions and each of the test carefully before you start to code.
- We recommend you to get (however you like) this folder, so you can send it back to us and we will easily check your changes ;)
- Each folder has a different test, some will require extra files, some won't. You're free to modify these files in order to complete the test, just be sure that your answers will work out-of-the-box or create a README file about how to set it up (or automate it).
- Each test is completely unstyled, but we do like pretty things too.
- Complete the Skill Tests we prepared for you, there's no numeration of the test so difficulty its not progressive, so be ready.
- We will use internet-enabled computers while reviewing your work, so don't hesitate to use online resources just don't blame us if it goes down :)
- We would love to see minified code, but please also send us the original un-minified code.
- You DON'T need to complete ALL the tests to send them back to use, you can choose and go for quality over quantity. But the more the merrier.
- Please let us know an ETA for your test. We're ok if you take one or two weeks.
- Assume general pluses for all tasks:
    + No jQuery or 3rd party JS libs, external CSS is ok.
    + Readable and logically documented code, no need to document each line, but one or two lines in the interesting parts is ok.
    + JSHint/Lint pass.
