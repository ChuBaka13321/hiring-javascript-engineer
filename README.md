GumGum - JavaScript Engineering Skill Test
==========================================

Introduction
------------

In this Skill Test we will try to assest your knowledge and experience when it comes to develop
using JavaScript language.
We will also cover some other web-based development tools and concepts.

**What's important for us?**

- You are honest. Its OK to say _I don't know_.
- GumGum is highly dynamic, we move fast but we need to be careful.
- We prefer quality over speed, and speed over quantity.
- You are a team player, please be considerate while coding.
- Pay attention to the details.
- Be communicative.
- Be communicative. Really.

**So, what's covered in this exercises?**

- JavaScript. Core, raw, pure javascript. _We love jQuery too, but this position is not about it_.
- JavaScript patterns, OOJS or JSOO, closures, callbacks, scopes, prototypes and all that jazz.
- The Browser(s): DOM, BOM, Developer tools, Debugging, etc.
- Cross-Browser Compatibility: Hacks, Polyfills, performance comparisons, etc.
- Client-side communication.
- HTML(5) and CSS(3). Responsive design.
- Some TDD, some Git, some 3rd party software, etc.

Instructions
------------

- Read these instructions and each of the test carefully before you start to code.
- You DON'T need to complete ALL the tests to send them back to use, you can choose and go for quality over quantity. But the more the merrier.
- We recommend you to get (however you like) this folder, so you can send it back to us and we will easily check your changes ;)
- Each folder has a different test, some will require extra files, some won't. You're free to modify these files in order to complete the test, just be sure that your answers will work out-of-the-box or create a README file about how to set it up (or automate it).
- Each test is completely unstyled, we don't require you to beautify it but we do like pretty things too.
- There's no numeration of the test so difficulty its not progressive, so be ready.
- We will use internet-enabled computers while reviewing your work, so don't hesitate to use online resources (as long as they are available for us).
- We would love to see minified code, but please also send us the original un-minified code.
- Please let us know an ETA for your test.
- Assume the general rules for all the tasks:
    + No jQuery or 3rd party JS libs
    + No PHP/Server-side processing.
- For bonus points on all tasks:
    + Readable and logically documented code, no need to document each line, but one or two lines in the interesting parts is ok.
    + JSHint/Lint pass.
