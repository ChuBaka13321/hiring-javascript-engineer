    <title>GumGum - JavaScript Engineering Skill Test - OO && TDD</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Part 1) Write a small Object-Oriented <!--or prototype-oriented--> JS program that can create Robots with some nice greetings and interactions, three or four actions are ok.</p>
    <p>Part 2) Draw the robots in HTML, better if we can see their interactions.</p>
    <p>Part 3) Write some tests for all these robots. At least 5 tests.</p>
    <p>Part 4) Let us know what would you use and how to test their visual representations, or even better code it. If you need extra libs for this is ok.</p>
    <p>Part 5) Let us know how would you automate all these test, so whenever we release Robots V2.0 we would know everything is ok.</p>
    <p><b>Rules</b></p>
    <p>- You can use 3rd party libs and extra files, just let us know why you used them.</p>
    <p>- Write a 3-4 lines explanation of your OO pattern.</p>
